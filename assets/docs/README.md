# "My First Milestone Project": DanteHealy (author) on 'Finance Transformation'

## Background 

My first project from The Code Institute Full Stack Developer course is to create a fully functioning webpage using HTML, CSS plus applicable frameworks e.g. Bootstrap. 
The subect involves Finance Transformation which I'm passionate about and is actually my target career. 
I'm also including my bio in case this webpage interests anyone who might be looking for a Finance change agent.
