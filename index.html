                    A significant number of Transformations fail, top thinkers confidently quote a 70% failure rate. It’s hard to put a measure of success especially as transformation data is proprietary to each company, but the rough estimated range is somewhere between 40% - 80%. The success or failure of a transformation depends on changing the behaviours within the Finance team. <br>
                    A Finance team that is valued by the rest of the business expects Finance to be a coach rather than scorekeeper. However, without a clear vision of what exactly needs to change and how to change business partner satisfaction remains elusive.

                    <p>There is no one-size fits all approach to change as every Finance team has their unique set of needs and challenges as well as different existing levels of digital maturity. For those who are faced with years, perhaps decades, of underinvestment and institutionalised workarounds the challenge to transform will be far more difficult.</p><br>
                    <p>In these instances we face the accumulation of many rational short-term decisions, built up that become increasingly more difficult to untangle. Essentially you end up with a set of repeated patterns of behaviours (or habits) that become harder to change as more time elapses. This situation in software development is referred to as technical debt where the Finance team’s ability to change becomes increasingly more difficult and expense e.g. the need to hire more staff to support increasing manual workload.</p><br>
                    <p>Eventually the situation becomes unsustainable, but allows such a situation to be tolerated before it becomes too late to delay the need to change?</p><br>
