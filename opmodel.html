                        <li>Focused understanding on measuring business performance rather than the majority of resource focused on manual transaction processing</li> 
                        <li>Foster meaningful business relationships between Finance and the rest of the organisation</li>

                        <li>Able to deliver rapid, insightful business insights to enable the business to pivot</li>

                        <li>Have a culture of Data and Financial literacy, not just within the Finance team, but across the business so that effective communications are enabled through common language</li> 
                        <li>A culture of risks where failure is fast feedback and losses are minimised as lessons learned are integrated and applied going forward</li>

                    <p>With all the available digital tools and technology it should be easier than ever for Finance to transform. Why then is this not the case? Perhaps because Finance Leaders have too many options that it’s difficult to identify the ‘best’ one. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In this case where it limits progress we should consider simply aiming for ‘better’ rather than ‘best’. Other reasons that may prevent securing the support for a transformation programme include:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weak Business Case ROI, where smaller teams have limited costs base for savings and cannot link Finance transformation to business growth</li>
                            <li>The costs and risks for Finance to move away from legacy architecture increase as more time passes</li>
                            <li>Low risk tolerance and no room for experimentation because risk of failure linked with change is higher</li>
                            <li>Complex business systems with many different touch points that need to be fully analysed end to end</li>
                            <li>Finding the ideal solution that fits the company best possible fear of committing to a solution that becomes later becomes the least desirable (vendor lock-in)</li>
                            <li>Finance might be perfectly happy with their existing systems and see no urgency to change</li>
                             <li>No experience with a proven change methodology and limited SME resources available</li>

                    <p>The change process has been defined using a number of change methodologies and frameworks i.e. Waterfall (PMP / PRINCE2), AGILE (SCRUM, KANBAN), Lean Six Sigma, Change Management etc. with the same basic elements, but greater emphasis on different parts. Like Finance these are a collection of tools, each with their own unique strengths and limitations, best placed to handle certain specific problems. The fundamental components to an effective Transformation plan are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Charter: Identify the need to change and lay out the Vision</li> 
                        <li>Stakeholder Engagement: Identify and communicate to those impacted by the proposed change for engagement and support</li> 
                        <li>Business Case: Analyse the benefits and estimate the costs determine what key resources will be needed to provide a tangible Return on Investment</li> 
                        <li>Initiate: Get formal approval for funding and kick-off the project</li> 
                        <li>Planning: Get all the necessary inputs and develop realistic plans that can be monitored</li> 
                        <li>Resources: Create and coach effective teams to lead the change initiative, ensure that sufficient funding is available to achieve the plan</li> 
                        <li>Governance: Monitoring project progress plus ongoing Risk and Issue management</li> 
                        <li>Analysis: Evaluate the gap between the current state versus the desired future state 
                        Mapping existing then future systems structures and processes end to end</li> 
                        <li>Measure: Establish effective KPI’s (those that focus on leading indicators) making them available to the relevant stakeholders</li> 
                        <li>Communicate: Throughout the process so issues can be effectively addressed</li> 
                        <li>Close Out: Monitor post-launch and follow up to ensure stakeholder satisfaction and ensure project commitments i.e. benefits are realised</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are many essential traits to change leadership, but most valuable I’ve experienced and observed in leading successful transformation are communication, focus, ownership, integrity, curiosity, problem solving and resilience.</p>
