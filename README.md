# "My First Milestone Project" by Dante Healy on 'Finance Transformation'
## Background 
My first project from The Code Institute Full Stack Developer course is to create a fully functioning webpage using HTML, CSS plus applicable frameworks e.g. Bootstrap. 
The subect involves "Finance Transformation" which I'm passionate about and is my current target career. 
I've included my bio and contact in case this webpage interests anyone who might be looking for a Finance change agent. 


## User Experience
The purpose of this website is to build my personal brand by leveraging my knowledge of Finance transformation and communicate my value by educating Finance professionals on how to effectively link strategy to execution through the use of target operating models. 

- As a Finance Leader, I can learn about what makes a Finance Transformation successful so that I can apply best practice in my plans to design and deliver effective change. 
- As a Finance Professional, I can learn about “Finance Transformation” so that I can decide if it’s a suitable career path for me. If it resonates I might also follow Dante for more thought leadership.
- As a recruiter and employer I can evaluate Dante's expertise with delivering Finance Transformation and contact him for further opportunities. 


## Features
Building a website based on x3 sections as per initial wireframes (Balsamiq) with working navigation and a responsive layout using a mobile-first approach. 

### Overall for all pages 
Navbar header - has a navigation menu that collapses when viewed on smaller screens placed in the top right corner. The Logo image is hyperlinked so that the user can go straight back to the home page without opening the hamburger to toggle. 
The footer has social media icons with links to my social media accounts in order to connect and / or follow me. 

### Home Page: 
Problem statement on the challenge of Finance Transformation. 
Heading and subheading was followed by an image that zooms on hover. 
Then more content with some hyperlinks plus further text aligned next to images for illustration. 

### Operating Model 
Presented as the Target Operating Model as a solution for translating the high level plans into a clear map for solving the challenge posed on the Home page. 
More text explaining how Operating models work with an outline of the groups (People, Process and Technology) on Bootstrap cards with image, text and icons for illustration. 
More text on the challenge of Transformation then a picture of a path that also zooms on hover. 
Then text content about successful execution. The key components are illustrated with icons and more text. 

### Contact
My photo with a short bio. I have two buttons with flashing arrows one on top ("Mailto:" popup) and one below (link to my CV) a carousel running past some of my LinkedIn endorsements providing social proof of my credibility. 
Further down the page I list some useful links including my previous blogs plus the details of Professional organisations I'm associated with.

## Testing

### Reviews
Tested the screens myself on multiple devices (Laptop, iPad and iPhone 7)
Sent the webpage to my selected friends and family to test on their devices and feedback  
Posted my link via workflow on the Peer-Review SLACK group with the Code Institute
Had my content and design reviewed by certain select people amongst my LinkedIn contacts for any changes neede. 
Tested all the links and features as I was coding. 
Any obvious spacing, design or layout issues were fixed or de-scoped shortly after issue identification. 


### Coding Error checks
Used the validator to check HTML and CSS code to verify it was clean. Corrected it until all the tabs returned as clean. 
Double-check the visual effect on multiple screens using the 'Am I Responsive?' online tool.
